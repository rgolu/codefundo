my idea is to build an app that helps in creating and managing volunteer and self help groups.
The app will ask volunteers to choose  from a variety of tasks like human rescue group ,animal rescue group , emergency grop providing first add sevices ,group taking care of basic needs like food,water,blankets etc...
It will also allow financial help.
we can achieve this by first creating account of volunteers and then allowing them to create groups based on their choice.
It will also  diffent groups  to  communicate with each other and information about nearby rescue camp and their needs by using algorithms that provide best route to reach out to them ,considering weather conditions,their needs,road conditions,near by military camp etc , and will also inform about needs of different rescue camps so that different groups work their best to reach out to them.
